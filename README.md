Custom site provisioners for VVV

These provisioners build on VVV's default provisioners to add PMC-specific
customizations to each provisioned site. 

## Usage

These provisioners are referenced by the VVV configuration managed in the
[pmc-vvv](https://github.com/penske-media-corp/pmc-vvv) repository.

For example:
```yaml
sites:
  pmc.com:
    skip_provisioning: false
    repo: git@github.com:penske-media-corp/pmc-vvv-site-provisioners.git
    branch: main
```

Full configurations are automatically generated by a utility in the `pmc-vvv`
repo, hence the truncated example.

## Available provisioners

Each branch corresponds to a particular type of provisioner.

As of December 2020, we have only one provisioner, which is tailored to our VIP-
Go-hosted sites.

### `main` branch

This provisioner builds on the 
"[Custom Site Template](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template)"
provisioner that is the default for new sites in VVV.

The Custom Site Template provisioner is included as a submodule and invoked by
the main provisioner before PMC modifications are applied.

See [vvv-init.sh](./provision/vvv-init.sh) for more details.
